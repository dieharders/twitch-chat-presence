## Live demo: https://twitch-chat-presence.firebaseapp.com/
This browser app color codes chat messages to let you know who is present or has left the channel. It will also draw moderator/staff/sub/etc badges next to names and fade out messages by age. Overall this app aims to help make sense of the chat in regards to being engaging with your audience which can be tough to keep track of while playing games.

## Colors
White = Unchanged status of chatter.
Green = Chatter just joined the channel.
Red   = Chatter just left the channel.
